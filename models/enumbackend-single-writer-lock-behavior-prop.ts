 * Specifies the condition under which to acquire a single-writer lock to ensure that the associated operation will be the only write in progress at the time the lock is held. The single-writer lock can help avoid problems that result from database lock conflicts that arise between two write operations being processed at the same time in the same backend. This will not have any effect on the read operations processed while the write is in progress.
